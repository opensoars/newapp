  1. `npm install newapp -g`

## Use
CLI: `newapp type_of_app`

## Customize
It is really easy to add and edit projects to build using newapp. Just go to the directory newapp is install in and locate the projects folder. If you save a project inside a folder with a descriptive name in here, it can be used by newapp. Let's say I've just added a project called `rails`. Now I can simply type `newapp rails` and it will get build!
